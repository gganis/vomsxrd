{"name":"Vomsxrd","tagline":"VOMS attributes extraction plug-in for SCALLA/XROOTD","body":"\r\n  This project provides a plug-in to extract the VOMS attributes for the SCALLA/XROOTD\r\n  system. The plug-in is primarily intented for usage in conjuction\r\n  with the XrdSecProtocolgsi authentication plug-in. It can, however, be used in\r\n  others XROOTD plug-ins.\r\n\r\n  This plug-in uses the official VOMS client libraries. This dependency is the main\r\n  reason why the plug-in is not distributed with the SCALLA/XROOTD main distribution\r\n  stream-line.\r\n\r\n  The plug-in source code is under 'src' and consists in two files: XrdSecgsiVOMSFun.cc\r\n  and XrdSecgsiVOMS.hh; the header file contains the interface for standalone usage.  \r\n\r\n  Build and usage instructions are included in README.md.\r\n\r\n  The plug-in name is libXrdSecgsiVOMS.so .\r\n\r\n  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
